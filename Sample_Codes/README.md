Sample Codes for phoeniX core
====================================== 

In this directory, there are two subdirectories including sample codes in RISC-V assembly and C.

### Assembly codes
These RISC-V assembly codes were written and simulated in [Venus Simulator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hm.riscv-venus). You can add new assembly codes and simulate them on phoeniX core using `Assembly_to_Memory.py` script. Instructions are included in the script, you can execute it an read the manual inside the application.

### C codes
All of the codes inside this directory are executed with [RISC-V GCC comiler toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain) in Linux. You can add new codes to this directory using `phoeniX Code Executant` Python script which is included in its own [sepcific directory](https://github.com/ArvinDelavari/PHOENIX-CORE/tree/main/phoeniX_Code_Executant). Futher descriptions are included in the mentioned directory.
